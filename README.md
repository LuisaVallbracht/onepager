This is not my best work but I hope everyone appreciates my efforts. I've tried to check everything off the checklist, just the realization on phone screens has not quite worked out. It's fine but unfortunately the hover effect has gone to play the flute (as we say in Germany). 
I hope you still enjoy my little website and maybe learn something new about color gradients, even though I highly doubt that.
I look forward to learning more about coding during my upcoming studies, because I actually like doing it!
Thank you!!
